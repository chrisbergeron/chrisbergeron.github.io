For those that don’t drive this car, the IMA light indicates that the main hybrid vehicle battery is failing at capacity.  In Georgia, this light means you will not pass State emissions which is a requirement.  Additionally, you lose a tremendous amount of power, which is kind of the point of the electric motor.<br><span id="more"></span><br>I got repair quotes but they were quite excessive - to the tune of thousands of US dollars.  I looked at purchasing a new IMA battery and replacing it myself, but it was still $2,500 USD for that alone!  I did some research on various forums and I determined that <em>in theory</em> I could buy USED IMA battery cells and replace the cells that weren’t holding a charge very well.  I could do this for a few hundred dollars and quite a bit of labor.  Well, against all recommendations I decided to go the DIY route.</p>

<p>This is my commuter car: A 2000 Honda Insight hybrid that gets 50+ MPG</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-1-small.JPG" alt="My 2000 Honda Insight" title="Photo of a 2000 Honda Insight hybrid vehicle with goofy looking rear wheel covers."></p>
<p>The Honda Insight is a two seater hybrid compact.  It’s very similar to the old Honda CRX, but the rear hatch is smaller and it houses a large 144v DC battery pack called ‘MIMA’.  In order to access the MIMA, I had to remove the rear carpeting and the spare tire wheel well.  I didn’t take a lot of pictures of removing the battery, but I recall several aluminum plates secured by sheet metal screws (I think).  It was <strong>a lot</strong> of work and the battery pack itself is <strong>incredibly heavy</strong>.  I has two plastic handles built in which were helpful but this would definitely been much easier with two people.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-2-small.JPG" alt="After removing the rear carpet" title="Photo of the trunk of a car without carpet covering."></p>
<p>Moving in closer, there appears to be a warning label.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-3-small.JPG" alt="WARNING HIGH VOLTAGE" title="An orange warning label which reads You will be killed or hurt."></p>
<p>Yep, there is a label which reads, <strong>“You will be killed or hurt.”</strong>  Zooming in on the label doesn’t seem to make it any less lethal.  Sound serious.  Let’s keep going.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-4-small.JPG" alt="You will be killed or hurt." title="A closer view of an orange warning label which reads You will be killed or hurt."></p>
<p>Here is the IMA Battery Pack on my work table.  I probably should have done this in the garage, but since I needed some of my electronics tools like voltmeters and potentially a soldering iron and heat shrink tubing, I decided to haul it upstairs to my office.  Did I mention this thing is <strong>INCREDIBLY HEAVY</strong>  I don’t recall the weight but it’s at least 100 lbs (45 kilograms).</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-7-small.JPG" alt="The mIMA battery pack ready to be disassembled" title="A photo of a Honda IMA battery pack on a table."></p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-13-small.JPG" alt="Preparing to remove the cells from the IMA Battery Pack" title="Yet another photo of the MIMA Battery pack."></p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-6-small.JPG" alt="The standalone mIMA Battery Pack" title="A photo of a Honda IMA Battery Pack"></p>
<p>Upon closer inspection the battery pack itself also has a label.  This one is much less verbose and much more pointed.  At least they gave me handles to help with carrying this thing.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-5-small.JPG" alt="Final Warning Label" title="Another orange warning label that simply reads You will be killed or hurt."></p>
<p>This is the backside of the MIMA.  I didn’t touch anything on this side.  I can see a large inline fuse and resistor along with some vent tubes that I presume are thermal.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-8-small.JPG" alt="One of the business ends of the battery pack" title="A photo of one side of the battery pack with various connections, fuses and electrical components."></p>
<p>This is the other side of the battery pack.  This is the end that I worked on.  I removed the four large corner bolts with a socket.  The battery cells have hex heads on them that need to be removed as well.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-9-small.JPG" alt="The other business end of the battery pack" title="A photo of the converse side of the battery pack.  It&#39;s a large orange cover plate with a few wires and bolts."></p>
<p>After removing the bolts, I was able to finesse the orange plate lose.  There were small insulators / pads that cover each cell end.  You can see one as a ring in the lower right corner on the table.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-10-small.JPG" alt="Removing the cover plate" title="A photo depicting prying an orange plastic plate off of the battery pack."></p>
<p>Here is a more detailed view of the cover plate.  I forgot to mention that there are little tabs poking through.  These also had to be gently removed and finessed through their mating holes.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-11-small.JPG" alt="Closer view of the orange cover plate" title="Closer view of the orange cover plate"></p>
<p>Here you can see the individual cells that make up the full battery pack.  The small green tabs on each cell are thermistors.  They measure the cell temperature and report it up to the hybrid controller / ICU.  They throw a fault if a single cell overheats or otherwise fails.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-12-small.JPG" alt="The individual cells that make up the full battery pack" title="A photo of the individual cells that make up the full battery pack"></p>
<p>This is an individual cell.  It’s comprised of six 1.2 volt batteries.  They’re encased together in heat shrink tubing with a thermistor running the entire length.</p>
<p><img src="Upgrading-Honda-Insight-IMA-Battery-14-small.JPG" alt="Individual IMA Battery cells" title="A photo of the individual 7.2v cells composed of six 1.2volt individual smaller batteries laying on a beige and brown berber carpet.  Chris s finger is also seen in the photo."></p>
<p>After removing the cells, I had to test each of them on my bench desk.  This was a time consuming process as I had to discharge and recharge them a few times.  The goal was to find the weakest cells from my pack and replace them with the newer cells from the used pack that I purchased on eBay.  Basically, I had to test all of the sticks from <strong>two</strong> MIMA packs and take the best and put them in the MIMA battery housing.</p>
<p>Installation was the opposite of removal.</p>
